# Kernel difference 

- Recommended Use: There is no `.TF` in the name of the `kernel folder`, you can use the `openwrt-install` command to install into `EMMC`, can use `openwrt-update` to update the version in `EMMC`, and use it without inserting a `TF-Card or USB`, (It can also be used in `TF-Card or USB` without writing into `EMMC`.) E.g: `5.9.8`
- Public Beta: The names containing `.TF` is recommended to be used in `TF-Card or USB`. The `TF-Card or USB` must be inserted in the STB for a long time. E.g: `5.10.16.TF`
